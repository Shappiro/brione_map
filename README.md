# Brione reserve map

Map has been created as a showcase of [iNaturalist](www.inaturalist.it) potential to nature reserve's managers.
The application was mainly created through the [*qgis2web*](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) [QGIS](www.qgis.org) plugin, selecting [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) as map library, with some minor crafts. Points have been added through [iNaturalist API](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#get-observations).  

A demo of the application is available [here](http://159.65.92.135/index.html).

The application has been realized under the support of the Rete di Riserve BIM - Basso Sarca administration.
